            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight: bold;">I</span>n my last post, I told you guys I didn’t stick to a single skill till now so why so,
            Interest , Excitement and Enthusiasm is most important for any kind of work or skill one wants to learn, if someone is interested in Cricket there is no point in dragging yourself in some other field. 
        </p>
        <img class="hero-img" style="padding: 1rem 0rem;" src="images/doors-img.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Now the next important point is hard work, If you are interested in some field the first step to be successful in that is hard work you can’t achieve something without working hard in that field.
        </p>
         <p>
            Second point is working in RIGHT DIRECTION and this is most important step if you work hard but you are not working in right direction then your all hard work will go in vain.   
        </p> 
        <p>
            So when I start coding in C,C++ i was following both the step but at some point of time i lost interest and start finding it boring, and there is no point in dragging my self even after losing interest.
            This Post was all about if you find your work boring then you are not in right field.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Kindly share your views on it, being new in writing i was not finding a good point to write so just share another story about my life with the lesson i have learnt from it.
